# joro-carbon-portfolio

Joro launched our personalized offset subscription, the Net Zero Membership, in April 2021. With the subscription, we announced our criteria and approach for sourcing and evaluating offsets: https://www.joro.app/blogs/introducing-the-joro-carbon-portfolio. 

The source materials in this repo represent the core of our carbon offset purchases. We're sharing them with the public here, in the spirit of transparency and accountability.

The truth is, not all offsets are equal. The work we do to source, research, evaluate, and monitor carbon providers is critical to a responsible offsetting strategy. 

We evaluate offsets based not only on the integrity of their carbon reduction or removal (verifiability, enforceability, additionality, permanence, transparency), but also on their potential to transform our world into a more just and sustainable one (efficiency, scalability, catalytic potential, ecosystem benefits, community benefits). See more details on how we select projects here: https://www.joro.app/how-we-select-projects.
