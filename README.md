# joro-carbon-portfolio

Not all offsets are equal. Our team of experts evaluates and monitors the best providers on the market. Think of us as your personal sustainability team. We evaluate offsets based not only on the integrity of their carbon reduction or removal (verifiability, enforceability, additionality, permanence, transparency), but also on their potential to transform our world into a more just and sustainable one (efficiency, scalability, catalytic potential, ecosystem benefits, community benefits).
